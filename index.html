        <p>Are you new to using git? Do you only know the basics of version control (commit, branch and
           automatic merges)?  Are already a git user, but have problems with conflict resolution and
           merging?</p>

        <p>The talk will include hands on exercises, so please come prepared. Sign-up for a github
           account and bring your laptops with git pre-installed. Please install the git command line
           tool. <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Download Git</a> Your favorite IDE probably
           includes a git plugin, but it will not be suitable for this workshop. Most IDEs don't
           support all of the commands we use during the hands-on exercises.</p>

      <section>
        <p>Git is a distributed version control system.</p>
        <p>Distributed = No central authority</p>
        <p>Any repo can be cloned and hosted on a different computer.</p>
        <p>You can even distribute git changes in unique ways. Sending patch files via email</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Who is the administrator of your git repo clone?</p>
        <p>You</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>You have the ability to modify anything in your git clone.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can merge changes to master without a review</li>
          <li>Rewrite commit metadata so it looks like you are the author</li>
          <li>Rewrite the entire commit history of the master branch</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That seems dangerous</p>
        <p>However, you can only do this to your own repo. There are mechanisms in place
           so you can't push these changes to repos on github.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Under the hood git is storage system for git objects.</p>
        <p>branches and lightweight tags are named references. Heavyweight tags are
           named references, but also include a second git object to identify who
           created the tag and when.</p>
      </section>
        <p>There is no builtin delete for git objects</p>
        <p>objects are only deleted after being unreferenced or compressed for x days.
        <p>Git will compress git objects that need to be maintained but haven't been used
           for x days</p>
        <p>The way it works is similar to the garbage collector in your favorite modern
           programming language.</p>

        Time for 1st Exercise
        Cloning Repo
        git clone git@github.com:careyrp/git-power.git
        each exercise has one or more branches
        also there are two branches
        master - is normally the default location for maintaining your project
        gh-pages - is special branch github uses to generate html pages
        For git-power.git master is intentionly out of date so we can do our exercises
        gh-pages is our up to date branch.

        checkout has many uses
        switch branches
        create a new branch
        reset a single file
      </section>
      <section>
        HEAD
        HEAD^
        HEAD^^
        master
        tag
        sha you only need first 6 characters
        linux kernel is the oldest repo with active commit history. That makes it the largest repo in regard to number of commits. linux kernel needs 8 characters to uniquely identify a commit
        master..example01
        master...example01
        git merge-base example01
